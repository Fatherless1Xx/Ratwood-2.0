/*
Oooooh boy. This is an odd introduction, and an even worse file path. But hear me out.
These are ported from a port I did of Escalation(?) on F13, elsewhere, which was picked up and brought elsewhere.
It's a huge mess. Just know that this is cool. And it kicks ass.
I've also cleaned this up and made it functional for our purposes. - Carl
Design:
 * Deploy bombard.
 * Have someone get you coordinates with the dedicated tool.
 * Punch coords in. How does it work, IC? I don't know. MAGIC!!!!
 * At some point during the above, you fill it with powder and then pack with a rod.
 * LOAD AND FIRE!!!!
Balance:
This is, as of the moment, limited to Pioneer. To even the playing field for brigands.
Playing field? Eight MAAs, two knights, one KC, eight mercs, etc.
Lets have the funny guys have to come to the bandits, rather than the other way around.
This is incredibly expensive to run. Old Dragonscale levels of expensive.
It's also VERY loud, as in most of the map is going to hear it firing if in range.
This will also KILL people. It is absurdly strong, or at least the projectiles are.
Requirement of the fusilier trait for aiming and gathering coordinates should limit the intensity.
